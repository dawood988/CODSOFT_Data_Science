Titanic Survival Prediction:

Analyzed the Titanic dataset to build a model predicting passenger survival based on features like age, gender, ticket class, and fare.
Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis.
Implemented machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) to develop the predictive model.
Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC curves.
Movie Rating Prediction:

Developed a regression model to predict movie ratings using features such as genre, director, and actors.
Conducted data preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Utilized machine learning techniques like linear regression and gradient boosting to estimate movie ratings.
Assessed model performance through RMSE, MAE, and R-squared metrics.
Iris Flower Classification:

Used the Iris dataset to create a classification model distinguishing between setosa, versicolor, and virginica species based on sepal and petal measurements.
Applied data normalization and visualization techniques for better feature understanding.
Trained classification algorithms (e.g., k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines) to classify iris flowers.
Evaluated model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Sales Prediction:

Forecasted product sales by analyzing factors such as advertising expenditure and target audience segmentation.
Preprocessed sales data, performed feature selection, and engineered new features to enhance model accuracy.
